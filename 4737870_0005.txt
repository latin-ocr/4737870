This reel ot microfilrrt contains material
which has paper oolor changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear ort
pa9es mixed with printed text). ln order to

ensure that all text and illustratione are ,
leqible‚ exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text artd illustrations exist
in a single image or when material
bacquouncls differ, such trames may need
to be exposed twice.

'l'he first exposure reflects the camera
operator’s best effort to capture tlte majority
ot tlte text; tlte seconcl exposure reflects the

camera operator's best ettort to capture
illustrative material or the remaining text. lt

is hoped that this practice will result in a
miorotilrn procluot that fully serves tlte needs

of most researolters.
